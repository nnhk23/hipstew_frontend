# Hipstew (Frontend)

Hipstew is built to help user look for recipes based on ingredients instead of name. You can also keep track of your fridge using a Fridge feature and also look up ingredients to add as well! There is also a chatbot, Stewy, who will assist you with conversion, recipe search or just to have a small talk with, be sure to check it out :)!
